# 🚀 Cervical Fracture Detection Using ML 🧠🔍
Traditional CT scans often fail to detect occult fractures in cervical bones  leading to delayed diagnosis and severe complications like immobility and spine immobilization in the long run.

My ML-based model leverages Edge Detection technology using the Sobel operator to enhance fracture visibility, enabling early and accurate detection. This innovation aims to revolutionize cervical injury diagnosis, ensuring timely medical intervention and better patient outcomes.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting cervical fractures using image processing techniques, specifically leveraging the **Sobel Operator** for edge detection. The goal is to develop a reliable and efficient method to assist in the early diagnosis of cervical fractures using medical imaging.

## 🏥 Problem Statement
Cervical spine fractures are critical injuries that require early detection to prevent severe complications. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert radiologists, which can lead to delays in diagnosis. This project aims to automate the detection process using **computer vision** and **machine learning**, improving accuracy and reducing diagnostic time.

## 🚀 Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Noise reduction and grayscale conversion
- **Edge Detection**: Application of the **Sobel Operator** for identifying fracture patterns
- **Feature Extraction**: Analyzing the detected edges to classify fractures
- **Machine Learning Integration** (Optional): Training a classifier for automated detection

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **NumPy & Matplotlib** (for visualization and data handling)
- **Scikit-learn/TensorFlow** (if ML integration is used)
