# 🚀 Cervical Fracture Detection Using ML 🧠🔍

Traditional CT scans often fail to detect occult fractures in cervical bones (C5, C6, C7), leading to delayed diagnosis and severe complications like immobility and spine immobilization in the long run.

My ML-based model leverages Edge Detection technology to enhance fracture visibility, enabling early and accurate detection. This innovation aims to revolutionize cervical injury diagnosis, ensuring timely medical intervention and better patient outcomes.
